    "description": "High medical bills are the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the U.S.A primary cause of this is the lack of price and quality transparency in the medical industry. Two providers in Maryland can charge significantly different prices for the same procedure with the same quality of care. Patients typically do not know the cost of a procedure until after they receive the bill.\n\nComparedCare was founded in 2013 with the goal of providing patients the ability to compare the cost of care among providers within the same area. Users may upload / input their medical bill information anonymously (without any PHI or Personally Identifiable Information) into the ComparedCare medical bill repository. Patients can actively search for the cost of a medical procedure within their area for comparison, as well as read physician reviews submitted by patients. It is a one stop shop for medical pricing for patients.",

Rather than spend $10K-$155K per day to operate an oceanographic vessel, customers can now launch an unmanned Wave Glider for months and up to a year of wide-ranging data collection. Leading organizations like the NOAA, BP and top oceanographic institutions have all adopted the Wave Glider for their unique mission requirements.</p>",

Endorsed and co-branded by the FDA, MedWatcher currently covers all US drugs, devices, and vaccines, with expansion into the EU in progress. \n \n<p>Half of all Americans take a prescription drug, yet 86% of adverse drug events go unreported, according to HHS, with most reports coming from manufacturers. Reports that do get submitted are processed by the FDA and made public on an irregular basis -- monthly, quarterly, or sometimes even less frequently. This information system is slow, resulting in many missed safety signals, and puts patients at risk.</p>\n \n<p>MedWatcher tackles this issue by making it vastly easier to report adverse events and by sharing adverse event data immediately with patient and provider communities. With direct involvement from patients, a high volume of data, and a user-friendly, transparent system, MedWatcher is a powerful tool for making drugs, devices, and vaccines safer.</p>",
